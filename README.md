# ShoppingList
A project for a course in Object Oriented Programming in Java.
The application consists of two small projects. One is a simple JSON parser, and the other is a GUI throgh which the user can input data into a shopping list, which can be written to a JSON file.

This app also uses the Hibernate API to store shopping lists into a H2 database, and the Dropbox Java API to store the shopping list json files into the user's Dropbox account.
